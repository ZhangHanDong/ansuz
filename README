== Ansuz

Ansuz is an open source Content Management System built in Ruby on Rails. 
It aims for a modular / plugin-based design, and should have more features 
out of the box than any other Rails CMS weâ€™re aware of.

By combining the CMSes of Isshen Solutions and Isotope 11, we plan to create 
a best-of-breed technology suitable for production use on a myriad of sites. 
Ansuz will be licensed initially via GPLv2.
