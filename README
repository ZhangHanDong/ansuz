== Ansuz

Ansuz is an open source Content Management System built in Ruby on Rails. 
It aims for a modular / plugin-based design, and should have more features 
out of the box than any other Rails CMS we’re aware of.

By combing the CMSes of Isshen Solutions and Isotope 11, we plan to create 
a best-of-breed technology suitable for production use on a myriad of sites. 
Ansuz will be licensed initially via GPLv2.
