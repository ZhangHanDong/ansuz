In order to launch a new site in the most retarded-simple way possible, it is only necessary to:

- set env var ANSUZ_LAUNCH_DIR
- Ask name of project: @project_name
- Ask domain to use

At the end of this operation, if the domain specified points to the server this operation is carried out on, the ansuz installation should appear.

This will require:

- checkout the project
  - `git clone git://github.com/knewter/ansuz.git #{File.join(ANSUZ_LAUNCH_DIR, @project_name)}`
- create the databases: #{@project_name}_[development|test|production]
- rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
- rake db:migrate:plugins RAILS_ENV=production
- rake utils:create_admin
- setup the vhost for the domain
- restart apache
- inform the user to visit http://domain/admin and log in as admin/admin
- add the ability to change your damn password.
