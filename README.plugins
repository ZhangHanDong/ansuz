== Things you might care about when writing plugins for ansuz ==

The API is currently a mess, full of poorly named things.  This will change, and invariably break backwards compatibility.  This is one of many reasons that ansuz is not in a high release number yet.  Having said that, I'm the only person I'm currently aware of that has written plugins for ansuz, so it's not like it's THAT inappropriate of me, and if you'll email me (josh at isotope11 dot com) I'll help you port any plugins you happen to write during this time of instability.  It's totally usable.  Just weird, inconsistent, and incomplete.

1) register_plugin(klass) will register a page plugin by its main container class.  This will enable a user to add your page plugin to a page.
2) register_plugin_nav( title, link ) will register a link for the user-facing nav menu
3) register_admin_plugin_nav( title, link ) will register a link for the admin-facing nav menu.  This is how you add bits to the admin interface for managing your plugin.
