    To install a theme, just click on it.<br /><br />

    At the moment, the only repository available to you is the master theme repository at www.ansuzcms.com.  This is hard coded in, and there's currently no interface for adding new theme repositories (but one's coming!).  If you're adventurous and desperate, ansuz's main repository is the same code you've got, so you could easily change the hardcoded value to your own instance of ansuz and be off and running.<br /><br />

    For what it's worth, this process <%= link_to "should be getting beefed up anytime now.", "http://ansuz.lighthouseapp.com/projects/15780-ansuz/tickets/8-beef-up-ansuz-theme-repository" %>
